            Seven killed as rival cult groups clash in Ogun state Tommy, one of
            the suspected cultists killed Seven persons have been killed
            following a clash that ensued between two rival cult groups in
            Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. It was gathered that members of
            the Aiye and Eiye confraternities have been engaging one another in
            a supremacy battle since last week. On Thursday night, March 24, a
            popular area boy, known as Tommy around Oluwo, was killed at
            Panseke, causing tension among residents. The killing of Tommy, who
            was described as a leader of the Eiye cult group, was said to be in
            retaliation for the murder of a member of the Aiye group. Before
            Tommy was hacked to death, six others had been killed by suspected
            rival cultists in various locations in the state capital. Some of
            those killed so far include “Scatter, School Boy, Alakanni, Tommy,
            Azeez, Olaosebikan and Babajide. They were reportedly killed at
            different locations like Asero, Kugba, Ikereku, Panseke, Adigbe, Oke
            Ijeun and Isale Abetu, all in Abeokuta. Spokesperson of the State
            Police Command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the killings in the
            state within the last one week, said some people have been nabbed.
            Oyeyemi added that the police will now go after the landlords who
            harbour cultists in their houses within the state. "We have launched
            a very serious operation on them. We are clamping down seriously on
            them. About 18 suspects have been arrested during the last encounter
            we had with them and we are not going to rest until we get the last
            person of these hoodlums, because we cannot be watching anyone
            making life difficult for members of the public," the PPRO stated.
            “The Commissioner of Police has put all Area Commanders and all
            tactical team commanders on the red alert that they should go out
            and take the battle to the doorsteps of these hoodlums. We must fish
            them out one after the other. "Any house that is harbouring any of
            these criminals, the landlords of such houses will be seriously
            dealt with. They cannot continue harbouring them and now coming out
            intermittently to wreak havoc. Are they pretending as if they don’t
            know them?" Seven killed as rival cult groups clash in Ogun state
